## üß™ **Routing System Test Results**

### **‚úÖ Test 1: Command-First Routing** 
- **Scenario**: "Quick security scan of this directory"
- **Routes To**: `/analyze --focus security` command
- **Reasoning**: Simple utility, speed priority, well-defined scope
- **Fallback**: backend-architect agent if command fails

### **‚úÖ Test 2: Agent-First Routing**
- **Scenario**: "Design scalable microservices architecture for e-commerce"  
- **Routes To**: backend-architect agent
- **Reasoning**: Complex system design, domain expertise required, strategic impact
- **Benefits**: 500+ word expert prompt, architectural patterns, quality consistency

### **‚úÖ Test 3: User Preference Override**
- **Scenario A**: "Use git-workflow agent to commit changes"
- **Routes To**: git-workflow agent (as requested)
- **Scenario B**: "Run /analyze for security check"  
- **Routes To**: `/analyze` command (as requested)
- **Result**: User preferences always honored

### **‚úÖ Test 4: Quality Gates & Escalation**
- **Scenario**: "Format and optimize React component"
- **Initial Route**: `/cleanup` command for formatting
- **Quality Gate**: Command lacks React-specific knowledge
- **Escalation**: frontend-developer agent for React expertise
- **Result**: Quality standards maintained

### **‚úÖ Test 5: Multi-Domain Orchestration**
- **Scenario**: "Build viral TikTok app with AI, payments, social sharing in 2 weeks"
- **Routes To**: studio-coach orchestration
- **Coordinates**: mobile-app-builder, ai-engineer, backend-architect, growth-hacker, ui-designer, tiktok-strategist
- **Commands Used**: `/build`, `/test`, `/git`, `/workflow` for utilities
- **Result**: Expert coordination + utility efficiency
