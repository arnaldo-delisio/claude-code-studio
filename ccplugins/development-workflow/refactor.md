- **Monitoring Setup**: Performance tracking and error detection for post-refactoring validation

### Comprehensive Refactoring Strategies

#### Extract Method Refactoring
```typescript
// Before: Complex method with multiple responsibilities
class UserService {
  async processUserRegistration(userData: UserData): Promise<User> {
    // Input validation
    if (!userData.email || !userData.password) {
      throw new Error('Missing required fields');
    }
    if (!this.isValidEmail(userData.email)) {
      throw new Error('Invalid email format');
    }
    
    // Password security
    const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(userData.password, 10);
    
    // Database operations
    const existingUser = await this.userRepository.findByEmail(userData.email);
    if (existingUser) {
      throw new Error('User already exists');
    }
    
    // User creation
    const newUser = await this.userRepository.create({
      ...userData,
      password: hashedPassword,
      createdAt: new Date()
    });
    
    // Email notification
    await this.emailService.sendWelcomeEmail(newUser.email, newUser.name);
    
    // Audit logging
    await this.auditService.logUserCreation(newUser.id, userData.ipAddress);
    
    return newUser;
  }
}

// After: Refactored with extracted methods and improved architecture
class UserService {
  async processUserRegistration(userData: UserData): Promise<User> {
    await this.validateUserInput(userData);
    await this.checkUserExists(userData.email);
    
    const secureUserData = await this.prepareSecureUserData(userData);
    const newUser = await this.createUser(secureUserData);
    
    await this.handlePostRegistrationTasks(newUser, userData.ipAddress);
    
    return newUser;
  }
  
  private async validateUserInput(userData: UserData): Promise<void> {
    const validator = new UserInputValidator();
    await validator.validate(userData);
  }
  
  private async checkUserExists(email: string): Promise<void> {
    const existingUser = await this.userRepository.findByEmail(email);
    if (existingUser) {
      throw new DuplicateUserError('User already exists');
    }
  }
  
  private async prepareSecureUserData(userData: UserData): Promise<SecureUserData> {
    const passwordService = new PasswordSecurityService();
    return await passwordService.secureUserData(userData);
  }
  
  private async createUser(secureData: SecureUserData): Promise<User> {
    return await this.userRepository.create(secureData);
  }
  
  private async handlePostRegistrationTasks(user: User, ipAddress: string): Promise<void> {
    const tasks = [
      this.emailService.sendWelcomeEmail(user.email, user.name),
      this.auditService.logUserCreation(user.id, ipAddress)
    ];
    
    await Promise.all(tasks);
  }
}
```
