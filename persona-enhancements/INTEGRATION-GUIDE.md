## üöÄ **How to Use Enhanced Agents**

### **Option 1: Direct Agent Reference (Recommended)**
```yaml
# Use enhanced agent directly
Task:
  description: "Design scalable API architecture"
  subagent_type: "backend-architect"  # Will use enhanced version
```

### **Option 2: Explicit Enhanced Agent Call**
```yaml
# Explicitly request enhanced version
Task:
  description: "Build responsive component with accessibility"
  subagent_type: "frontend-developer-enhanced"
```

### **Option 3: Agent Integration (Future)**
Replace existing agent files with enhanced versions:
```bash
# Replace original with enhanced (backup first!)
cp agents/engineering/backend-architect.md agents/engineering/backend-architect-backup.md
cp persona-enhancements/engineering/backend-architect-enhanced.md agents/engineering/backend-architect.md
```
